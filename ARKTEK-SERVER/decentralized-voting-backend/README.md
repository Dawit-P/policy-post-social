# README for Decentralized Voting Backend

## Project Overview

The Decentralized Voting Backend is a Node.js application that provides a secure and efficient way to conduct voting using blockchain technology. This backend service handles all voting-related operations, including creating votes, retrieving vote results, and managing voter authentication.

## Features

- **Vote Creation**: Allows users to cast their votes securely.
- **Vote Retrieval**: Enables users to view the results of the votes.
- **Vote Deletion**: Provides functionality to remove votes if necessary.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Utilizes blockchain technology for secure and transparent voting.
- **Authentication Middleware**: Ensures that only authorized users can perform voting operations.
